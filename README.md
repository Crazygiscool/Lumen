**Lumen** is a secure, offline‑first journaling engine built with a Rust core and a cross‑platform Flutter UI. It focuses on privacy, clarity, and long‑term durability — giving you a fast, encrypted space to write without distractions.

> *Illuminate your inner world. Write in light. Store in silence.*

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Local Encryption**  
  Entries are encrypted using AES‑256 and Argon2. Nothing leaves your device.

- 🧱 **Rust Core Engine**  
  Handles encryption, storage, entry management, and provenance metadata.

- 🖥️ **Cross‑Platform UI**  
  Flutter interface for Linux and macOS (other platforms compile but are not yet polished).

- 🧑‍💻 **Terminal UI (TUI)**  
  A functional command‑line journaling interface for quick writing and reading.

- 📁 **Import/Export**  
  Export entries to plaintext Markdown. Import from plaintext and basic JSON.

- 🗂️ **Entry Metadata**  
  Each entry includes timestamps, edit history, and structured provenance.

- 🛠️ **Cross‑Platform Build Pipeline**  
  Automated builds for Linux and macOS, including Rust FFI and Flutter bundling.
